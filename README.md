# Battle Champ

**Battle Champ** is a user management system built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes features such as user registration, login with mobile numbers, and wallet management. The project provides a backend API for managing users, supporting functionalities like account creation, login, and updating user details, with restrictions on modifying wallet data.

> **Note**: This is the backend portion of the game, involving real money betting and prize systems. The system allows users to play games and win prizes, with wallet functionalities for winnings, deposits, and bonuses.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Create new users with mobile number, email, and name.

  - **Bonus Wallet** (with â‚¹10 bonus upon registration)
- **User Update**: Update user details such as name and email while protecting wallet data from modifications.
- **API Security**: Secured with JWT authentication.
